# Upgrade to new Microsoft Teams with Microsoft 365 Apps

Starting in late August, 2024, new Teams will automatically install with new and existing installations of Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows.

>[!Important]
>If the classic Teams app is already installed, the Microsoft 365 Apps deployment will install new Teams alongside classic Teams on the device. The classic Teams installation will not change.

## Rollout schedule

For more information on the timeline for new Teams, see [End of availability for classic Teams client](teams-classic-client-end-of-availability.md).

## Prerequisites for target computers

See [New Teams system requirements](teams-client-system-requirements.md) for information on requirements for the new Teams client.

## Office 365 plans that don't include Microsoft Teams

Some Office 365 plans include Microsoft 365 Apps, but don't include the Teams service. Teams will still be installed with Microsoft 365 Apps even if a plan doesn't have the Teams service.

For Office 365 plans that don't include the Teams service, a free trial version of Teams, valid for one year, is available. Your users can start using it when they sign in to Teams. For more information about this free trial version and providing your users access, see Manage the Microsoft Teams Commercial Cloud Trial offer.
