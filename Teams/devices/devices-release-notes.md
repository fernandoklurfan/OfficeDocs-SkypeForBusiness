> [!IMPORTANT]
> Important: Starting June 2025, Teams applications on Phone devices older than 5 months will no longer work. Please refer to the Message Center Post, MC969451 for more details.

##### Queues app

We're excited to announce the Queues app for desk phones, a Teams solution that empowers organizations to efficiently manage customer engagements, starting with calls on certified Teams Phones. The experience is primarily for agents and includes a dedicated Queues app on the home screen. This app allows agents to view and opt in or out of all the call queues an agent is part of. Agents can also view others on the line along with call history of the call queue.

> [!NOTE]
> - The Queues app is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization who are assigned both a Teams Premium and Teams Phone license and who are voice enabled. To learn more about managing the Queues app, see [Manage Queues app for Microsoft Teams](../manage-queues-app.md).

##### Circular delegation

Circular delegation now allows users to share lines with each other as a group on Teams Phone devices. This feature is useful for scenarios where multiple users need to manage shared lines. In a typical circular delegation setup, User A delegates to User B, and User B delegates to User A, allowing them all to share the line with each other. This setup can be configured using cmdlets because the Teams client and Teams Admin Center don't currently support this feature.

##### Multi-banner updates

The multiple-banners feature improves the user experience by managing notifications more effectively on phone devices. When users receive multiple notifications, the system allows users to collapse all notifications or clear them in bulk, providing a cleaner and more organized interface.
