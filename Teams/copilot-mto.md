# Manage B2B member access for Copilot in Teams

Copilot in Teams enhances users’ day-to-day work with features like AI-generated summaries in chats and suggested action items after a meeting. Microsoft now supports **B2B member access** to Copilot in Teams for licensed users in multi-tenant organizations to ensure they never lose access to Copilot’s benefits in Team channels and meetings.

**B2B member access** lets people in your org collaborate with members of other organizations in an external Microsoft Entra organization. This is done by using Microsoft Entra External ID for business-to-business (B2B) collaboration and granting member-level access to Teams channels, meetings, and other resources in your org. For more information about B2B collaboration, see [B2B collaboration](/entra/external-id/user-properties).

> [!NOTE]
> B2B member access is possible only when both organizations allow access to and from each other. Therefore, you need to coordinate with the external organization’s admin to make sure their cross-tenant access settings allow sharing with you. For more information about cross-tenant access settings, see [Overview: Cross-tenant access with Microsoft Entra External ID](/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview).

Teams admins can toggle off and on the **Allow Copilot for B2B members** setting in the Teams admin center or with PowerShell. This setting is turned on by default, allowing external members from other organizations who have Copilot licenses to use Copilot when they join meetings hosted by your organization.

## Manage B2B member access to Copilot in the Teams admin center

1. Sign in to the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851) using your admin credentials.
1. Expand **Users** from the left-side navigation pane.
1. Under **Users**, select **B2B member access**.
1. Either select an existing policy or create a new one.
1. Toggle the **Allow Copilot for B2B members** setting **On** or **Off**.
1. Select the **Save** button.

## Manage B2B member access to Copilot using PowerShell

The **Allow Copilot for B2B members** setting can also be managed using PowerShell with the [Get-CsTeamsMultiTenantOrganizationConfiguration](/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsmultitenantorganizationconfiguration) and [Set-CsTeamsMultiTenantOrganizationConfiguration](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsmultitenantorganizationconfiguration) cmdlets.

To learn how to manage Teams settings using PowerShell, see [Manage Teams with Microsoft Teams PowerShell](teams-powershell-managing-teams.md).

### Sample scripts

Retrieve your multi-tenant organization’s Teams configuration by using the following code:

```powershell
Get-CsTeamsMultiTenantOrganizationConfiguration 
```

Turn off the **Allow Copilot for B2B members** setting by using the following code:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsMultiTenantOrganizationConfiguration -Identity Global -CopilotFromHomeTenant Disabled  
```

Turn on the **Allow Copilot for B2B members** setting by using the following code:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsMultiTenantOrganizationConfiguration -Identity Global -CopilotFromHomeTenant Enabled  
```
