> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Virtual Appointments app in Microsoft Teams won’t be available after June 30, 2025. After this date, users can no longer access the Virtual Appointments app.
>
> To schedule and manage appointments, users can use Microsoft Bookings. As part of Microsoft 365, Microsoft Bookings is an online scheduling tool that enables users to create customizable booking pages where customers, clients, and colleagues can easily schedule appointments.
>
> - For advanced scheduling features in Microsoft Bookings, like SMS notifications and the queue for scheduled appointments ([available in early 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=470136)), users also need a Teams Premium license, same as they would today.
> - On-demand appointments, the queue for on-demand appointments, client-side analytics, and Microsoft Forms, which are currently part of the Virtual Appointments app, won’t be available in Microsoft Bookings.
>
> For existing Virtual Appointment app users, we recommend using Microsoft Bookings, licensed through a Microsoft 365 subscription plan, together with a Teams Premium license for a more comprehensive solution.
>
> To prepare for this upcoming change, notify your users, update relevant documentation as appropriate, and share details on Microsoft Bookings.
