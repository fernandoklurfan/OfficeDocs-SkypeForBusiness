# Microsoft Teams update monitoring

- Microsoft Teams update monitoring in the Teams admin center allows administrators to proactively monitor Teams client updates and versions, and helps identify users who aren't on the latest version of the Teams client.
- Admins can monitor the overall update and adoption status of the latest version of the Teams client across Windows and Mac devices in their organization. 
- This page provides a Teams client update status from users in your organization. It groups devices into three update statuses:
  - Latest Build
  - One or more builds behind
  - Outdated

|Client update status      |Definition |
|--------------------------|-----------|
|Latest build              |If a device is running a Teams client build newer than the last 100% released build. |
|One or more builds behind |If a device is running a Teams client build less than 30 days old and older than the last stable build, it's **One or more builds behind**. |
|Outdated                  |If a device is running Teams client build less than 90 days old and more than 30 days old, it's identified as **Outdated**. |

- The **Health tab** shows different data information, such as:
  - Client versions, their release date, version status, and platform.
  - Devices on this version.
  - Users on this version.
  - Percentage of total users.

- Health Metric:
  - Device crashes
  - Device launch failures

### Client version details

Admins can see their organization's client version distribution and adoption of each client version, as well as the health of each client version.
