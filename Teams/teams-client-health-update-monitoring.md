# Microsoft Teams update monitoring

As an admin, it’s important that your users have the latest and the most secure version of the Teams client. Teams update monitoring in the Teams admin center allows you to proactively monitor Teams client updates and versions and helps identify users who aren't on latest version of Teams, so you can support them.

This dashboard highlights the client update status for the devices in your tenant and gives Microsoft recommended insights for moving users to the latest version of Teams client.

## Access the Teams update dashboard

To access the update monitoring and insights dashboard:

1. Go to the Teams admin center. XXX PERMISSIONS HERE?
1. Select **Teams client health** from the navigation pane. XXX DIRECTIONALLY WHERE, YOU CAN'T JUST RELY ON THE SCREENSHOT.
XXX NEEDS MORE DETAIL. IMAGINE YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS TO SOMEONE OVER THE PHONE.


XXX SCREENSHOT HERE.
XXX ALT TEXT WILL BE: A screenshot of the Teams client health page with callouts marked. The number one is next to a chart under the Teams client health heading. The number two is on the upper left-hand side of a table showing details. The number three is to the upper right of this table next to filtering and search options.

- Callout 1: The Client update widget displays the overall version status distribution for all devices in your tenant. The update status widget provides statuses by 3 categories:
  - Latest Build: A device is running a Teams client build newer than the last 100% released build.
  - One or more builds behind: A device is running a Teams client build less than 30 days old and older than the last stable build.
  - Outdated: A device is running a Teams client build less than 90 days old and more than 30 days old.
- Callout 2: The table under the **Health tab** shows a more detailed breakdown of this information, such as:
  - Client versions: The exact client version number.
  - Release Date: The date on which this specific client version was fully released to the general ring.
  - Version status: The Teams client version status.
  - Platform: The platform for the client version.
  - Devices on this version: The total devices in the tenant currently running this client version.
  - Users on this version: The total number of users in the tenant currently running this client version.
  - Percentage of total users: The percentage of total users in the tenant currently running the client version.
  - Device Crashes: The total number of devices that experienced a client crash in the last 28 days.
  - Device launch failures: The total number of devices that experienced a client launch failure in the last 28 days.
- Callout 3: You can use these buttons to:
  - Export the table to a CSV file.
  - Filter and search by versions.
  - Manage settings for columns in the table.

### Client version details

You can see your organization's client version distribution and adoption of each client version, as well as the health of each client version in your organization. To view a detailed dashboard with insights, select any version from the health table from a row in this table.

You can identify users and devices running outdated version of Teams, and review troubleshooting insights on issues preventing users from updating to a newer version of Teams.
