# Enabling and managing SMS operations in Teams Admin Center

This article is for IT administrators and IT professionals who are administering the Short Message Service (SMS) usage in Microsoftâ€™s Teams Admin Center (TAC).

## Prerequisites

### Brand and Campaign

To ensure successful enablement of SMS for a Teams Calling Plan phone number, confirm service enablement is configured, as described in the articles [Step 1: Create brand](sms-setup-brand.md) and [Step 2: Create campaign](sms-setup-campaign.md).

### Licensing

To proceed with enabling Teams users with SMS capabilities, the following must be provisioned:

- Users must be licensed with Teams, Teams Phone, and a Microsoft Teams Calling Plan. For more information, see [Licensing](sms-overview.md#licensing).
  
### Billing mechanism

A tenant **billing mechanism** *should* be in place for SMS consumption overages and *must* be in place for Pay-as-you-go Calling Plans.

- Funding for usage overages is supported either with prepaid Communication Credits using a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA) or with postpaid invoicing using a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA). For more information, see the article [Microsoft Calling Plan Overview](calling-plan-overview.md).

#### Permissions

Administrators must have one of the following Roles Based Access Control (RBAC) roles assigned:

- Teams Administrator
- Teams Communications Administrator
- Teams Telephony Administrator, or
- Global Admin

## Enabling SMS for a user

The first step in enabling SMS for a user is to SMS-enable the user's phone number. 

In Teams Admin Center (TAC), navigate to the left side rail, select ***Voice*** > ***Phone numbers*** > ***Numbers***, and then find and select the number for the user. In the contextual menu just above the list of phone numbers, select ***Enable SMS***

If the number isn't already assigned to a user, assign a user with the number. For more information on number management, see [Manage phone numbers for users](assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md)

## Disabling SMS for a user

To disable a user, in Teams Admin Center (TAC), navigate to the left side rail, select ***Voice*** > ***Phone numbers*** > ***Numbers***, and then find and select the number for the user. In the contextual menu just above the list of phone numbers, select ***Disable SMS***

## Confirming usage

To confirm SMS usage, in Teams Admin Center, navigate to the left side rail, select **Reports & analytics** > **Usage reports** > **PSTN and SMS Usage**, choose a date range, and select **Run report**.

For more information, see [Microsoft Teams PSTN Usage report](.\teams-analytics-and-reports\pstn-usage-report.md).
