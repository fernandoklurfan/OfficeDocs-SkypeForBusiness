# Best practice configurations dashboard for Microsoft Teams meetings

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)Meetings ![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)Webinars ![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)Town halls

As an admin, it’s important to ensure that your users have a reliable collaboration experience for their Teams meetings. The best practice configurations dashboard for Microsoft Teams meetings helps you manage and monitor your environment for seamless collaboration. This dashboard provides you with best practice configurations, the impact of your current settings, and actions you can take to follow Microsoft’s recommendations. The dashboard highlights locations that don’t follow Microsoft's recommended best practices. When you follow recommended actions, the trend of locations not adhering to best practices is tracked to help monitor progress. All monitored areas are evaluated over a period of 7 days.

## Access the best practice configurations dashboard

To access the best practice configuration dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Meetings** from the navigation pane.
3. Under **Meetings**, select **Best practice configurations**.

The **Summary** widget displays the number of best practices that need action and those without issues.

The **Best practice configurations** table provides statuses and insights for the following best practices:

- Enable the right ports and protocols
- Update out of date Teams clients
- Implement split tunnelling for VPNs

Select a best practice from a row in this table to view a detailed dashboard with recommendations.  A list of IP addresses is shown by city, displaying the extent to which each location follows best practices.  You can use the name of the city, country or region, or the IP address to search and filter for locations. You can also export the dashboard’s table in a CSV file that you can share.

## Interpret the dashboards

The following sections provide details on the information in each best practice configuration's dashboard.

### Update outdated Teams clients

For the best meeting experience, your users should always use the latest version of Teams. The outdated Teams clients dashboard tracks the desktop clients (Windows and Mac) across the organization and shows when users have outdated versions of the Teams client. For learn more about Teams updates, see [Why it's important to keep Teams updated](teams-client-update.md#servicing-agreement).

To view outdated Teams clients, select **Update out of date client versions** in the **Best practice configurations** table.

|Callout |Description  |
|--------|-------------|
|**1**   |**Update outdated clients**- Count of cities with supported and out of date Teams clients. |
|**2**   |**Client versions trend trend**-  Trend of cities with supported and out of date Teams clients. |
|**3**   |**Recommended action**- Actions you should take to meet the recommended best practice configurations.|
|**4**   |**Regions with out-of-date clients**- Visual map that includes a date for when this dashboard was generated and a count of cities with out of date clients. You can also search by country/city/region.|
|**5**   |The table provides the following data: <ul><li>**Cities**- Cities and regions impacted.</li> <li>**Public IPs (reflexive)**- Public IPs of users on outdated clients.</li><li>**Percentage of out-of-date clients**- Percentage of streams coming from outdated versions of the Teams client.</li><li>**Number of streams**- Count of media streams coming from outdated clients.</li><li>**Status: Action required**- You must follow Microsoft’s recommended actions to update the status.</li></li> </ul>|
|**6**   |You can use these buttons to: <ul><li>Export the table to a CSV file.</li> <li>Filter by city, public IP address, and status. .</li><li>Toggle the map view on or off.<li>Manage settings for columns in the table.</li></li> </ul>|

### Enable the right ports and protocols

The media streams in the **Enable the right ports and protocols** dashboard reflect Teams media communications conducted over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) instead of User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This dashboard monitors the tenant locations and highlights those that have a high proportion of streams using TCP.

You should open UDP ports on both the network and client firewalls to Microsoft Teams services to avoid any impact on meeting and call quality. UDP is the preferred network protocol for media streams and high rates of TCP usage can negatively impact the Teams user experience. To learn more about UDP ports and client firewalls, see [Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#microsoft-teams).

To view ports and protocols, select **Enable the correct ports and protocols** in the **Best practice configurations** table.

|Callout |Description  |
|--------|-------------|
|**1**   |**Ports & protocols**- Count of cities with TCP and UDP traffic. |
|**2**   |**Network traffic trend**-  Trend of cities with TCP and UDP traffic. |
|**3**   |**Recommended action**- Actions you should take to meet the recommended best practice configurations.|
|**4**   |**Regions with TCP traffic**- Visual map that includes a date for when this dashboard was generated and a count of cities with TCP and UDP traffic. You can also search by country/city/region.|
|**5**   |The table provides the following data: <ul><li>**Cities**- Cities and regions impacted.</li> <li>**Public IPs (reflexive)**- Count and list of public IPs (reflexive) that have high proportion of streams using TCP.</li><li>**Volume of TCP stream**- Volume of streams using TCP.</li><li>**Volume of UDP stream**- Volume of streams using UDP.</li><li>**Total streams**- Total of UDP and TCP streams.</li><li>**Percent of TCP**- Percentage of streams using TCP .</li><li>**Status: Action required**- You must follow Microsoft’s recommended actions to update the status.</li></li> </ul>|
|**6**   |You can use these buttons to: <ul><li>Export the table to a CSV file.</li> <li>Filter by city, public IP address, and status. .</li><li>Toggle the map view on or off.<li>Manage settings for columns in the table.</li></li> </ul>|

### Implement split tunnelling for VPNs

This dashboard monitors locations and highlights those that have a high proportion of streams routed through the VPN. For reliable connectivity to Teams, you should implement a direct connection for VPN users to Microsoft Teams services. To learn more about VPN split tunneling, see [Implementing VPN split tunneling for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-vpn-implement-split-tunnel).

To view split tunneling for VPNs, select **Implement split tunneling for VPNs** in the **Best practice configurations** table.
