# Send an email to a user with their Audio Conferencing information in Microsoft Teams

Sometimes, Microsoft Teams users need you to send them their Audio Conferencing information. As an admin, you can do this by selecting **Send conference info via email** under the properties for a user. When you send this email, it contains all of the Audio Conferencing information, including the conference phone or dial-in phone number for the user.

Here's an example of the email that is sent:

There are several emails that are sent to users in your organization after they're enabled for Audio Conferencing:

- When an **Audio Conferencing** license is assigned to them.
- When you manually reset the user's Audio Conferencing PIN.
- When an **Audio Conferencing** license is removed from them.
- When the Audio Conferencing provider for a user is changed from Microsoft to another provider or **None**.
