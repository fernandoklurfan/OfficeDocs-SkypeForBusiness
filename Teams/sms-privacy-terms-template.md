# Creating a privacy policy with terms and conditions for SMS on the 10DLC network

This article is for IT administrators and IT professionals who are enabling Short Message Service (SMS) in Teams. It's an example template that you can use when creating your company's privacy policy with terms and conditions related to SMS messaging in Teams.

## Prerequisites

Ensure fundamental understanding of the **purpose** for a Campaign, as described in the article, [Learn about SMS Texting in Teams](sms-overview.md).

Both a privacy policy *and* terms and conditions are required when applying to register your company's SMS campaign with [The Campaign Registry](https://www.campaignregistry.com/about/).

## Using this template

**How to use this template:** SMS providers in the US, Puerto Rico, and Canada require that the initial message to an SMS recipient must include a link to reference the following assets from your company:

- Terms and conditions
- Privacy policy
- Information about how to get help

Senders are also required to provide the recipient with certain terms specific to the use of an SMS service.

To simplify these requirements, many senders find it useful to have **a single webpage that includes all relevant terms, information, and required links in one place**&mdash;that way, only one link needs to be included in the initial message to the recipient.

This SMS Terms of Use Template includes relevant SMS terms and placeholders where you can insert links to your general terms and conditions, privacy policy, and help information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DISCLAIMER: This template is for informational purposes only and isn't intended as, and should not be substituted for, consultation with appropriate legal counsel and/or your organization's regulatory compliance team.  This template is applicable only to approved uses of the Teams SMS service&mdash;that is, conversational person-to-person communications&mdash;and doesn't apply to unauthorized use cases such as marketing, promotional, transactional, or other commercial SMS. Appropriate terms may vary depending on how you use this service and the nature of your business, and we recommend seeking legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory and legal obligations.

## SMS Terms of use

**[COMPANY NAME]** TEXT MESSAGE SERVICE PRIVACY POLICY

We respect your privacy. We only use information you provide through this service to transmit your mobile messages and respond to you. This includes, but isn't limited to, sharing information with platform providers, phone companies, and other vendors who assist us in the delivery of mobile messages. WE DON'T SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER FOR PROFIT ANY PHONE NUMBERS OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE SERVICE TO ANY THIRD PARTY.

This Text Messaging Service is for conversational person-to-person communication between you and our employees. We may send you an initial message providing details about the service.  After that, the number of text messages you receive will vary depending on how you use our services and whether you take steps to generate more text messages from us (such as by sending a HELP request).

OPTING OUT OF TEXT MESSAGES

If you no longer want to receive text messages, you may reply to any text message with STOP, QUIT, END, REVOKE, OPT OUT, CANCEL, or UNSUBSCRIBE. As a person-to-person communication service, opt-out requests are specific to each conversation between you and one of our employees and their associated phone number. After unsubscribing, we may send you confirmation of your opt-out via text message.
