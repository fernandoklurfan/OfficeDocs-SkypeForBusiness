## What is the new Teams?

The new Teams desktop client is reimagined from the ground up with performance in mind, providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. The new Teams client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks.

The new Teams ensures more efficient use of device resources. You can lower memory and disk usage with a Teams app optimized for your device. Whether you have users on multiple accounts or tenants, the new Teams can help eliminate the silos and bring them together in one place, giving them more extensibility and scale.

>[!NOTE]
>See [What's features are changing?](new-teams-known-issues.md) to review some of the changes you will see.

## Servicing agreement

Teams is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy, with the expectation that users remain on the most up-to-date version of the desktop client. Automatic updates ensure that users have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability. An in-app alert is displayed if the userâ€™s current version is between one and three months old, and if there's a new version available.

Learn more about the Modern Lifecycle Policy under the [**Servicing agreement**](/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement) for Microsoft Teams.
