# Try or purchase Audio Conferencing in Microsoft 365 for Microsoft Teams

Sometimes users in your organization need to use a phone to call in to a meeting. Microsoft Teams includes the Audio Conferencing feature for just this situation. Users can call in to Microsoft Teams meetings using a phone, instead of using the Microsoft Teams app on a mobile device or PC.

You only need to set up Audio Conferencing for users who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who call in to the meeting don't need any licenses assigned to them and don't need other setup.

For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/audio-conferencing?rtc=3).

## Step 1: Buy and assign Audio Conferencing licenses

You must be a [billing administrator](https://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d) to perform these steps.

### To buy and assign user Audio Conferencing licenses

1. Find out if **Audio Conferencing** is available in your country/region. [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

2. Get your **Audio Conferencing** licenses. If you want to:

   - **Try it** before you buy it: you can sign up for an Office 365 Enterprise E5 free trial that includes Audio Conferencing. See [Office 365 Enterprise E5 Trial](https://portal.office.com/Signup?OfferId=101bde18-5ffb-4d79-a47b-f5b2c62525b3).

   - **Buy it**: see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

3. [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.

4. If you purchased Audio Conferencing add-on licenses and Communications Credits licenses, assign them too. For instructions, see [Assign Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

### To buy and assign pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing licenses

If you're a Volume and Licensing customer, you can get pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing licenses. For more information on pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing licenses, see [Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute](audio-conferencing-pay-per-minute.md).
 
1. Find out if **Audio Conferencing** is available in your country/region. [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

2. Get your **Audio Conferencing** licenses. To acquire pay-per-minute licenses, contact your account representative.

3. [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md) for your organization. To set up Communications Credits, see [What are Communications Credits?](what-are-communications-credits.md)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If Communications Credits aren't set up, Audio Conferencing doesn't work for any users with pay-per-minute licenses.

4. [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute licenses, you must also assign a Communications Credits license separately to each user.

## Step 2: Set the Audio Conferencing provider for users who lead or schedule meetings

When you assign an **Audio Conferencing** license to users in your organization who don't have Teams integrated with a third party Audio Conferencing provider, they're all set up and ready to go! (You don't have to set their Audio Conferencing provider.)

If you have users set up with a third party Audio Conferencing provider, you must change the provider of those users to Microsoft. To change the provider for a user, see [Assign Teams add-on licenses to users](teams-add-on-licensing/assign-teams-add-on-licenses.md).

## Step 3: Other admin tasks

Many admins like to do these **optional** steps:

1. [Customize meeting invitations](meeting-settings-in-teams.md#customize-meeting-invitations). The dial-in numbers that are set for the user are automatically added to the meeting invitations that are sent to attendees. However, you can add your own help and legal links, a text message, and small company graphic.

2. [Set the phone numbers included on invites](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites-in-teams.md). This number is the phone number that shows up in the meeting a user schedules.

3. [Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing](set-auto-attendant-languages-for-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md) that the Audio Conferencing auto attendant uses to greet a caller when they dial in to an Audio Conferencing phone number. This step only applies if you're using Microsoft as your Audio Conferencing provider.

4. [Set the length of the PIN for Audio Conferencing meetings](set-the-pin-length-for-audio-conferencing-meetings-in-teams.md).
