# Manage Viva Engage experiences in Microsoft Teams

And, now Viva Engage can integrate into your users' Teams workflows.

This article outlines the technical details of the integration of Viva Engage experiences in Teams and instructs IT admins on how they can manage this feature.

## User experience of Viva Engage in Teams chats

The first Viva Engage experience to integrate with Teams chats is [storyline](/viva/engage/eac-storyline).

- Users can follow, view, and comment on others' storylines in Teams.
- Users receive notifications in Teams for relevant activity in storyline.
- Storyline conversations have a look and feel similar to other messaging experiences in Teams.

If users have [Viva Engage Premium](/viva/engage/setup#set-up-licensing-for-viva-engage), they receive the following extra capabilities:

- Assigned leaders can send storyline announcements.
- Users can post a storyline or comment on storyline posts on behalf of others as a delegate.
- Users can change the cover photo at the top of their storyline.
- Users can view personal analytics about their storyline.
