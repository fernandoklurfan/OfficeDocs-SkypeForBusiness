# What's the status of your port orders?

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)Microsoft Calling Plans

To see the status of your port order, in the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to  > **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, and then select **Order history**. Each port order status is listed in the **Status** column.

If the **Status** column isn't listed, select the gear-shaped setting icon in the **Order history** table, and enable the **Status** column.

You can view orders that are saved but not submitted, and orders that are submitted and in progress by selecting the order name.

Keep in mind the lead times for order processing, as described in [Port planning](port-order-overview.md).

If you need to inquire about an existing order, use the [Phone Number Service Center Portal](https://pstnsd.powerappsportals.com/) to contact the [Telephone Number Services (TNS) Service Desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-tns-service-desk.md).

When making an inquiry about an existing port request, find the related case for your order in the Phone Number Service Center Portal and provide your inquiry in the case comments, rather than opening a new case.
